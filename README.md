## 📚 About This Repository

Welcome! This repository serves as my personal learning ground and evolving portfolio for fundamental C programming concepts. It's a collection of basic coding examples, solutions to exercises, and experimental snippets I've worked on to strengthen my understanding of C. Whether you're a fellow learner or just curious, feel free to explore!

---

## 🎯 Core Purpose

The primary goals behind this repository are:

*   **To solidify my understanding** of core C language features and best practices.
*   **To build a practical portfolio** showcasing my coding skills and project progression 📈.
*   **To create a personal reference** for common C patterns and solutions.
*   **To have a dedicated space for experimentation** and exploring new C concepts as I learn 🤔.

---

## 📁 What's Inside?

Dive into various aspects of C programming. Each section contains focused examples:

*   🔄 **Loops:** Explore the power and versatility of `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loop structures with practical demonstrations.
    *   _Examples might include: pattern printing, iterative calculations, array traversal._
*   📝 **Functions:** Understand the building blocks of modular C code. Includes basic function implementations covering:
    *   _Parameters and arguments, return values, scope, and function prototypes._
*   📊 **Arrays:** Learn about array manipulation, including:
    *   _Initialization, accessing elements, multi-dimensional arrays, and common array-based algorithms._
*   📂 **File I/O:** Discover how C programs interact with the file system. Examples cover:
    *   _Opening, reading, writing, and closing files; error handling in file operations._
*   🔤 **Strings:** Delve into C-style string handling (character arrays) and manipulation:
    *   _Common string library functions (`strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcat`, `strcmp`), manual string operations._
*   **(More to come...)** _Pointers, Structs, Dynamic Memory Allocation, etc._

---

## 💻 Technologies Stack

*   **Programming Language:** C (Primarily C99/C11 standards)
*   **Compiler:** Typically GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or Clang
*   **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
*   **Platform:** Console-based applications
*   **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 🚀 How to Explore & Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rush1patel/C-Codes-Basics.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a specific section/file:**
    ```bash
    cd C-Codes-Basics/Loops  # or Functions, Arrays, etc.
    ```
3.  **Compile a C file:** (Ensure you have a C compiler like GCC installed)
    ```bash
    gcc filename.c -o output_executable_name
    ```
4.  **Run the compiled program:**
    ```bash
    ./output_executable_name  # On Linux/macOS
    output_executable_name.exe # On Windows
    ```

## 🚧 Current Status & Future Plans

This repository is an active learning project. I plan to:

*   Continuously add more examples covering a wider range of C topics.
*   Refactor existing code for better clarity, efficiency, and adherence to best practices.
*   Add more complex mini-projects to apply learned concepts.
*   (Possibly) Include basic unit tests for more critical functions.
